If your lemonade stand makes $200/yr, how much money do you make from your lemonade stand over 4 years? 

Do you know how much **total** money you have in your bank account from the information above? 

**Big takeaway:** We can know how much an amount *changes* without knowing the absolute amount in our bucket. But if we *want* to know the absolute amount, then we need an initial condition!

[Integration blitz]{.slide-title}

::: {.body-text-m}
**Integration:** A tool to get from rates back to amounts (e.g. $\frac{df}{dx}\rightarrow f(x)$)

We can think of it as *antiderivation*. 

- If $f(x)=x^2$, then $\frac{df}{dx}=2x$
- If $\frac{df}{dx} = 2x$, then $f(x)=?$

**Question:** if you don't know the original function and only have an expression for the rate (slope), then from the slope can you know the exact solution?

[Introduction to differential equations & solving them]{.slide-title}

::: {.body-text-m}
A **differential equation** is an equation containing a differential expression. So it describes rates, often related to a function containing our variables of interest.

<br>

**For example:** 

$$\frac{df}{dt}=3.2-f(t)$$

is a differential equation because it contains both a the function $f(t)$ and it's derivative,

$\frac{df}{dt}$.

## {#solve-numerically data-menu-title="Solve numerically"} 

[Solving differential equations numerically]{.slide-title}

<hr>

Find *approximate* solutions to differential equations when finding an analytical solution would be really challenging (...which is pretty often).

Instead, computers can numerically approximate solutions by predicting nearby values based on the *slope*. 

### There are many methods for solving differential equations numerically. Here we'll just get a little flavor. 

---

## {#many-methods data-menu-title="Many methods"} 

[The general process (many methods) exist]{.slide-title}

<hr>

From the expression for *slope* and using an initial condition & parameter estimates, start at one endpoint and incrementally calculate values of the solution from the slope expression until reaching the other endpoint.

This means that the approximate solution is found by approximating values of the solution at equal intervals of the independent variable (often, time).

## {#num-approx-DE data-menu-title="Approximation of DE solution"} 

[Example: numerical approximation of DE solution]{.slide-title}

<hr>

Let's say that we have a differential equation $\frac{dx}{dt}=2x+0.1$, and we don't know how to solve analytically for $x(t)$. Using the initial condition $x(0)=1$, let's numerically estimate the solution.

We'll create a table that estimates $x$ at increments of $t$ based on an approximation of the slope estimate $\frac{dx}{dt}$ . **WHAT?** It's OK, follow along.
 
(Aside: For a great example using the $\frac{dy}{dx}=y$ example above, see this [Khan Academy intro to the Euler method](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-differential-equations-new/bc-7-5/v/eulers-method))
