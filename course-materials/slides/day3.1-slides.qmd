If your lemonade stand makes $200/yr, how much money do you make from your lemonade stand over 4 years? 

<br>

Do you know how much **total** money you have in your bank account from the information above? 

<br>

**Big takeaway:** We can know how much an amount *changes* without knowing the absolute amount in our bucket. But if we *want* to know the absolute amount, then we need an initial condition!

[Integration blitz]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text-m}
**Integration:** A tool to get from rates back to amounts (e.g. $\frac{df}{dx}\rightarrow f(x)$)

<br>

We can think of it as *antiderivation*. 

- If $f(x)=x^2$, then $\frac{df}{dx}=2x$
- If $\frac{df}{dx} = 2x$, then $f(x)=?$

<br>

**Question:** if you don't know the original function and only have an expression for the rate (slope), then from the slope can you know the exact solution? 
:::

::: {.notes}
- $f(x)=x^2$

- No because we have no idea the value of the constant of integration. Without additional information, such as an initial condition or a specific value of the function at a particular point, you cannot determine the exact value of 
$C$

$$\int{x^n}dx=\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$$

<br>

[**Example:**]{.teal-text} If $\frac{df}{dx}=3.8x^2-2.1$:

<br>

a) Find a general expression for $f(x)$

b) Given the initial condition $f(1.4)=5.9$, find the particular solution for $f(x)$
:::

::: {.notes}
a. $\frac{df}{dx}=3.8x^2-2.1$
- $f(x) = \int(3.8x^2-2.1)dx$
- $f(x) = 3.8 \frac{x^3}{3} - 2.1x +C$
- **$f(x) = 1.267{x^3} - 2.1x +C$**
b. We need to solve for $C$!
- $5.9 = 3.8 \frac{1.4^3}{3}-(2.1)(1.4)+C$
- $5.9 = 2.48-2.94+C$
- $5.9 = 0.54+C$
- $C = 5.36$
- **So, the particular solution for $f(x)$ is $f(x) = 1.267{x^3} - 2.1x + 5.36$**

::: {.body-text-m}
A **differential equation** is an equation containing a differential expression. So it describes rates, often related to a function containing our variables of interest.

<br>

[**For example:**]{.teal-text} 

$$\frac{df}{dt}=3.2-f(t)$$

<br>

is a differential equation because it contains both a the function $f(t)$ and it's derivative, $\frac{df}{dt}$.

Predator: $\frac{dP}{dt}=\beta VP - qP$

- $V$ is number of prey (e.g. rabbits)
- $P$ is number of predators (e.g. wolves)
- $r, \alpha, \beta, q$ are positive parameters
:::

::: {.notes}
- $r$: intrinsic rate of increase
- $\alpha$: capture efficiency of predators (i.e. effect of a predator on per capita growth rate of prey population)
  - the larger $\alpha$ is, the more the per capita growht rate of a prey population is depressed by the addition of a single predator (e.g. baleen whales feeding on plankton vs. web-building spider capturing a mosquito)
- $\beta$: a measure of conversion efficiency (i.e. the ability of predators to convert each new prey ite m into additional per capita growth rate for the predator population) 
  - $\beta$ is high when a single prey item is high value (e.g. a moose prey to wolf predator vs. a seed to a bird)
- $q$: per capita death rate (these predators are extreme specialists with no alternative prey sources; so if prey are absent, the predator population declines exponentially)

::: {.body-text-m}
Find *approximate* solutions to differential equations when finding an analytical solution would be really challenging (...which is pretty often).

<br>

Instead, computers can numerically approximate solutions by predicting nearby values based on the *slope*. 

<br>

**There are many methods for solving differential equations numerically. Here we'll just get a little flavor.**

## {#many-methods data-menu-title="Many methods"} 

[The general process (many methods) exist]{.slide-title}

<br>
<br>

::: {.body-text-m}
From the expression for *slope* and using an initial condition & parameter estimates, start at one endpoint and incrementally calculate values of the solution from the slope expression until reaching the other endpoint.

<br>

This means that the approximate solution is found by approximating values of the solution at equal intervals of the independent variable (often, time).

[Example: numerical approximation of DE solution]{.slide-title2}

::: {.body-text-m}
Let's say that we have a differential equation $\frac{dx}{dt}=2x+0.1$, and we don't know how to solve analytically for $x(t)$. Using the initial condition $x(0)=1$, let's numerically estimate the solution.

<br>

We'll create a table that estimates $x$ at increments of $t$ based on an approximation of the slope estimate $\frac{dx}{dt}$ . **WHAT?** It's OK, follow along.
