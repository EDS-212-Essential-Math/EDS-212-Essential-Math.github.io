## Exponents & how to do math with them

$$x^n=x\times x\times\ x \times x...(n\space times)$$
### Exponent warm-ups
Evaluate the following to find a value for $y$:

1. $y = 12-2^4$

2. $2y + 30=y+3^3$

---

## Exponent rules

--

- $x^ax^b=x^{a+b}$ ; **Example:** $y^5y^3=x^{5+3}=x^8$

--

- $\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}$ ; **Example:** $\frac{z^5}{z^3}=z^{5-3}=z^2$

--

- $\frac{1}{x^a}=x^{-a}$ ; **Example:** $b^{-4x}=\frac{1}{b^{4x}}$

--

- $(x^a)^b=x^{ab}$ ; **Example:** $(2^3)^2=2^{3*2}=2^6=64$

--

- $(\frac{x}{y})^a=\frac{x^a}{y^a}$ ; **Example:** $(\frac{y}{2^2})^2=\frac{y^2}{(2^2)^2}=\frac{y^2}{2^4}=\frac{y^2}{16}$

--

- $(xy)^a=x^ay^a$ ; **Example:** $(3x)^2=3^2x^2$

---

## Exponent practice

Simplify the following expressions using the rules of exponents:

1. $3x^5x^8x^{-11}$

2. $\frac{-8x^6}{2x^4}+7x^2$

3. $\frac{3x}{x^5}-3.8x^4\frac{x^3}{x^6}+8.1x-11.2$

---

## Multiplying expressions (FOIL)

**F**irst, **O**utside, **I**nside, **L**ast

**Example:**

$$(2x+5)(x-3)$$
$$=2x^2-3*2x+5*x-5*3$$
$$=2x^2-x-15$$

# UNITS. UNITS. UNITS.

Think about these statements, which all contain the same *value* of 4:

- There are four in the refrigerator.

- There are four **burritos** in the refrigerator.

- There are four **roaches** in the refrigerator.

- There are four **million dollars** in the refrigerator.

---

class: center, middle

### Units are critical in environmental data science. We cannot responsibly work with data without knowing the units of **each variable we're working with**.

### That means we need to always **familiarize ourselves with metadata**, carefully **check units and any unit conversions**, and understand **how units combine into the units of a dependent variable**.

---

## Dimensional analysis for unit conversions

In dimensional analysis, we multiply initial units by a sequence of conversion factors to arrive at the final desired units. 

For example, to convert $100 \frac{g}{cm^3}$ into units of $\frac{kg}{in^3}$, given that 1 cm^3^ = 0.061 in^3^.

$$100\frac{g}{cm^3}*\frac{1kg}{1000g}*\frac{1cm^3}{0.061in^3}=1.639\frac{kg}{in^3}$$
---

## Unit conversion practice

Practice dimensional analysis to perform the following conversions:

1. Convert $8.1\frac{km}{s}$ to miles per hour, given that 1 km = 0.621 miles.

2. Convert a mass flux of $3.2\frac{g}{min\cdot m^2}$ to $\frac{mg}{s\cdot cm^2}$.

---

## Functions

Functions are mathematical expressions that tell us how input values are related to output values. 

For example, $y = 3x-5$ is a function that tells us the **value of y** at **any value of x**. In this scenario, we would probably say **y is a function of x**. 

Could you also rewrite it and say **x is a function of y**? Here, with no knowledge of what's an input and what's an output, sure - but usually in environmental data science we specify the input variable(s), and the output variable(s) carefully. What follows is the expression in the format of: "**[output variable(s)] is/are a function of [input variable(s)]**". 

---

## Thinking about inputs and outputs

For the following combinations of related variables, which do you expect would be the **input** and the **output** in a function describing how they are related? Say your answer in a sentence, e.g. "Evapotranspiration is a function of air temperature."

1. fuel (biomass) / slope / wildfire severity / windspeed / air temperature

2. wind speed / power generated by wind turbine

3. soil C:N ratio / bacterial biomass / soil water content / leaf litter decomposition rate

## Function notation

### Single variable (univariate) function: 

$f(x) = [expression\space containing \space x]$

### Multivariate function:

$g(a,T,z)=[expression\space containing \space a, T, \space and \space z]$

---

## Evaluating functions

For continuous functions, we evaluate them by plugging in variable values. 

### Example:

Evaluate $g(x,t)=2.4x+0.5t^2$ at $x = 3$ and $t = 10$

$g(3, 10) = 2.4(3) + 0.5(10^2)= 57.2$
