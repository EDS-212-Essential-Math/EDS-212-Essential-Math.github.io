## {#nat-exponent data-menu-title="Natural exponent"} 

[The Natural Exponential]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

In previous examples, we evaluated exponentials with different bases that were variables (e.g. $x^5$) and rational numbers (e.g. $2^4$). 

<br>

Here, we'll learn about the *natural exponential*, $e$, which appears frequently in environmental science and modeling.

<br>

[**First: $e$ is a number, not a variable: 2.71828182845904523536...**]{.body-text-m .teal-text}

<br>

It is an irrational number, yes - meaning it can't be expressed by a simple ratio of integers - but a number nonetheless. With infinite decimal places.

<br>

[***It is always the same value.***]{.teal-text}

## {#where-e-come-from data-menu-title="Where does e come from?"} 

[Where does $e$ come from?]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

::: {.body-text-m}
- The value is from continuous compounding over infinite intervals: $e=\lim_{n\to\infty}(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$

- The **e** is from Leonard **Euler**, Swiss mathematician who proved the value was irrational
:::

<br>

[**Why is it so common?**]{.body-text-l .teal-text}

::: {.body-text-m}
- **One reason:** Exponential trends show up a LOT in environmental science (the proportional change is the same over each time span)

- **Math reason:** Turns out it's a very useful value for calculus

## {#logistic-growth data-menu-title="Logistic growth"} 

[Logistic growth]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

[$$N_t=\frac{K}{1+[\frac{K-N_0}{N_0}]e^{-rt}}$$]{.body-text-l}

<br>

[Where $N_t$ is the population size at time $t$, $K$ is the carrying capacity, $N_0$ is the initial population size, and $r$ is a growth rate.]{.body-text-m}

<br>

::: {.center-text .body-text-m .teal-text}
We should always think about *why an equations has the shape it has* - both conceptually and mathematically.

## {#logistic-growth-Qs data-menu-title="Logistic growth (Qs)"} 

[Logistic growth]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

[$$N_t=\frac{K}{1+[\frac{K-N_0}{N_0}]e^{-rt}}$$]{.body-text-l}

<br>

::: {.body-text-m}
1. Why might we expect logistic growth for many populations? 

2. What variables *besides* time would influence the actual population?

3. Why, mathematically, does the logistic growth expression take the shape it does? What happens as the population becomes very close to the carrying capacity?

## {#logarithms data-menu-title="Logarithms"} 

[Logarithms]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

[Logarithms ask a question: $\log_a(b)$ asks "to what power do I have to raise $a$ to get a value of $b$?]{.body-text-m}

<br>

[**For example:**]{.body-text-l} 

- $\log_2(8)$ asks "to what power do I have to raise 2, to get a value of 8?"

- $\log_x(x^{5.9})$ asks "to what power do I have to raise $x$ to get a value of $x^{5.9}$?"

- $\log_{banana}(banana^{1382.95})$ asks "to what power do I have to raise $banana$ to get a value of $banana^{1382.95}$?"

## {#log-ruls data-menu-title="Log rules"} 

[Some log rules]{.slide-title}

## {#ln-e-in-equations data-menu-title="$ln()$ and $e$ in equations"} 

[Working with $ln()$ and $e$ in equations]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

::: {.body-text-m}
We can think of these as inverses of each other:

- $e^{\ln(x)} = x$

- $\ln(e^x)=x$
:::

. . . 

<br>

[...and use that as a tool for escaping variables from exponents & logs (remembering we can do whatever we want to an equation, as long as we do **the same exact thing to both sides**)]{.body-text-m}

## {#ln-e-examples data-menu-title="$ln()$ and $e$ examples"} 

[Examples]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

- [Find $x$ given $\ln(x) = 5$]{.body-text-m}

  Exponentiate both sides: $e^{\ln(x)} = e^5$ ; simplify LHS to get: $x = e^5$

<br>

- [Find $y$ given $e^{3y}=95$]{.body-text-m}

  Take natural log of both sides: $\ln(e^{3y})=ln(95)$ ; simplifies to: $3y = \ln(95)$, so $y = \frac{\ln(95)}{3}$

## {#graphs data-menu-title="Graphs"} 

[Graphs: visualizing & thinking about data]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

[Graphs are a way for us to more easily process trends or patterns that may be more challenging to understand in a table or list.]{.body-text-m} 

<br>

[When you look at graphs, the first things you should ask:]{.body-text-m}  

- What variables are plotted (e.g. x- & y-axis, including units)?
- What values are plotted (e.g. raw values, transformed, means, etc.)?
- What are the overall takeaways and am I understanding them responsibly?

## {#slope-avg data-menu-title="Slope (average)"} 

[Slope (average)]{.slide-title}

<hr>

<br>

Sometimes, it can be useful to find the *average rate of change* of a function. Between any two points on a function $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ the slope is found by:

<br>

[$$m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$]{.body-text-m}

## {#practice-out-loud data-menu-title="Practice out loud"} 

[Get into the practice of saying the meaning out loud]{.slide-title3}

<hr>

- As if you're explaining it to someone unfamiliar with the data
- Including units
- Without overstating certainty 

[**For example:**]{.body-text-m} 

>"Between 1972 and 2020 the price of hobbit homes increased by an average of $2,450 per year"

*differs from*
