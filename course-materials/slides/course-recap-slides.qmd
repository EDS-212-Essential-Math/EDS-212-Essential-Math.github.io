<hr>

**Math skills & concepts covered:**

- Basic unit conversions & dimensional analysis
- Back-of-the-envelope calculations & gut checks
- Exponents & logarithms (including logistic growth examples)
- Functions, function notation & terms, evaluating functions, creating a basic function in R
- Calculating average slope

**Tools & workflows stuff:**

- worked in Quarto docs within R Projects, then used `usethis::use_git()` and `usethis::use_github()` to connect to a remote repo

---

## {#day1b data-menu-title="Day 1b"} 

[Day 1 - Algebra warm-up & meeting our tools]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**Other stuff:**

- A graph with `{ggplot2}`
- Quarto introduction
- Made sequences with `seq()` , then evaluated a function over all values of a sequence
- Installed the `{tidyverse}`

---

## {#day2 data-menu-title="Day 2"} 

[Day 2: Derivatives!]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**Math skills / concepts covered:**

- Derivatives (definition of the derivative, what do derivatives mean, examples of applications)
- A few derivative rules
- Partial derivatives & what they mean
- Found & evaluated derivatives (incl. higher order & partials) in R
- Plotted a function in `{ggplot2}`

**Tools & workflows stuff:**

- Continued with git & GitHub 
- Building mental model of git (git mapping)

---

## {#day3a data-menu-title="Day 3a"} 

[Day 3: Differential equations]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**Math skills / concepts:**

- What is integration and what is it useful for?
- Notation and language for differential equations (e.g. "this is a second order partial differential - equation")
- Examples of finding numeric approximations for differential equations
- Lotka-Volterra equations as a DE example 
- Intro to linear algebra basics (what are scalars, vectors, & matrices), addition, subtraction & dot - products the vectors?

---

## {#day3b data-menu-title="Day 3b"} 

[Day 3: Differential equations]{.slide-title}

<hr>

**Tools & Workflows stuff:**

- New git/GitHub workflow:

**Math skills / concepts:**

- Basic matrix algebra (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- Representing systems of linear equations w/ matrices
- Leslie matrices for population projections and projected population structures several iterations into the future
- Summary statistics (central tendency)
- Some exploratory visualizations and how to think about them (e.g. boxplots, histograms, pair plots)


**Tools & Workflows stuff:**

- GitHub practice (forking, cloning, making a new repo & cloning, etc.)
  - New workflow: create a new repo from scratch on GitHub, > clone > create an R Project.

---
