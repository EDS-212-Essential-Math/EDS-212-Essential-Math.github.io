:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Standard deviation is expressed in the same unit of measurement as the data, and therefore can be easier to interpret -- for example it's more intuitive to report that a group of people's heights has a standard deviation of 3 inches, and less intuitive to report a variance of 9 square inches. 

Variances add (standard deviation doesn't). For example, if we say that sex explains four square inches of variance, you know that 5 square inches are due to other factors.

See [this discussion](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/35123/whats-the-difference-between-variance-and-standard-deviation) and [this discussion](https://www.quora.com/When-should-one-use-variance-instead-of-standard-deviation-given-that-both-numbers-measure-the-same-thing)

The variance measures the mathematical dispersion of data relative to the mean, and while theoretically correct, can be difficult to interpret in a real-world sense. Standard deviation is expressed in the same unit of measurement as the data (e.g. inches, rather than square inches), and therefore can be a more intuitive value to report.

1. Calculate the mean:

$$ mean = \frac{2+4+4+6+9}{5}=\frac{25}{5}=5$$
2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result:

$$(2-5)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9$$
$$(4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$$
$$(4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$$

$$(6-5)^2 = (1)^2 = 1$$
$$(9-5)^2 = (4)^2 = 16$$

$$Variance = \frac{28}{5-1} = 7$$

:::

::: {.notes}
Gave students a made-up dataset containing the BMI of 1786 people and the number of steps each took on a particular day. 

Students in Group 1 were asked to consider three specific hypotheses + also if there was anything else they could conclude from the dataset. 

Group 2 was simply asked, "What do you conclude from the dataset?"

If you plotted the number of steps vs. BMI, you'd find the gorilla. Students driven by hypotheses skipped this step more often than those that were not hypothesis-driven.

::: {.body-text-m}
What this **DOES NOT** mean: There is a 95% chance that the true population mean length is between 6.45 and 10.39 feet. 
:::

The true population mean is a *fixed value* and does not change -- the CI either contains this true mean or it does not. There is no probability involved.

. . .

<br>

::: {.body-text-m}
What this **DOES** mean: If we took a bunch of sets of samples from the population (all n = 15), then 95% of the time, the calculated mean would fall within this range.
<!-- What this **DOES** mean: 95% of calculated confidence intervals for samples drawn from this population will contain the true population parameter. This CI could be one of the 95%. It could also be one of the 5% that does *not* contain the true population parameter! -->

This statement correctly describes the frequency with which we would expect CIs to capture the mean over many samples.
