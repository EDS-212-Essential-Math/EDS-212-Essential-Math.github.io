## Section 1. Practice problems

### Evaluate the following:

1.  By hand: Evaluate $f(x,y)=x^2-1+3xy$ at $x=1$ and $y = 0$

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
$f(1,0)=1^2-1+(3)(1)(0) = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0$
:::

2.  In the R Console: given $G(t,z)=3.1(t-4.2)^2 + 0.06z$, find the value of $G(1, 2.5)$ (you do NOT need to write a function - just do the calculation in R using R as a calculator)

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
3.1 * (1 - 4.2)^2 + (0.06 * 2.5)
```
:::

### Units:

3.  You are combining information from multiple sources to estimate the total annual oil spilled in a watershed, reported by different companies. The following are reported for the year:

- **Company A:** 14.6 barrels spilled (with 9.3 barrels recovered)
- **Company B:** 692 liters spilled (94% recovered)
- **Company C:** 18.1 gallons spilled (0% recovered)

What is the total *unrecovered* amount of oil spilled into the watershed that year, in barrels. Use R & Google here for calculations. 

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)), one barrel of oil is equal to 42 gallons and ~159 liters.

- **Company A:** $14.6\; barrels\; spilled - 9.3\; barrels\; recovered = 5.3\; barrels\; unrecovered$
- **Company B:** $692\; liters \times \frac{1\; barrel}{159\; liters} = 4.352201\; barrels\;spilled\; \times 0.06 = 0.2611321\;barrels\;unrecovered$
- **Compnay C:** $18.1\;gallons\; \times \frac{1\;barrel}{42\;gallons} = 0.4309524\;barrels\;spilled\; \times 1 = 0.4309524\;barrels\;unrecovered$

**Total unrecovered barrels = 5.3 + 0.2611321 + 0.4309524 = 5.992084 ~ 6 barrels**
:::

### Average slope

4. By hand: If an urchin population in a study plot in 1990 is 432, and in 2004 is 801, what is the average rate of population increase? Find the slope, then write a statement about the average increase (including units).

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
$$slope\; (m) = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{801-432}{2004-1990} = 26.43$$
Between 1990 and 2004, urchin populations increased by an average of 26.43 urchins per year.

## Section 2: Projects and functions

a. Create a new R project (named `eds212-day1-tasks`)
b. Add a new Quarto document to the project
c. Press **Render** (save this in your project as `fish-length-weight.qmd`)
d. Delete everything below the first code chunk
e. Attach the `tidyverse` package

::: {.callout-important}
## Solution
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```
:::

f. Play around with markdown in the Quarto doc. Try adding text with at least the following:

  - Headers of varying size
  - Italics
  - Bold
  - Superscripts / subscripts
  - Bulletpoints
  - An image (google how!)
  
g. Add a new code chunk
h. Within the R code chunk, write a function to estimate fish standard weight, given parameters $a$, $b$, and fish length $L$ as inputs. "Standard weight" is how much we expect a fish to weigh, give the species and fish length, and the nonlinear relationship is given by:

$$W=aL^b$$ 

where L is total fish length (centimeters), W is the expected fish weight (grams), and a and b are species-dependent parameter values.

i. Test out your function to find the mass (g) for a 60 cm fish of the following species (parameter estimates from Peyton et al. (2016)): 

  - Milkfish: a = 0.0905, b = 2.52
  - Giant trevally: a = 0.0353, b = 3.05
  - Great barracuda: a = 0.0181, b = 3.27
  
::: {.callout-important}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
fish_weight_g <- function(length_cm, a, b){
  weight_g = a * length_cm^b
}
```

:::

j. Make and store (as `fish_length`) a sequence of size ranges from 0 to 200 cm, by increments of 1 cm

::: {.callout-important}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
fish_length <- seq(from = 0, to = 200, by = 1)
```
:::

k. Estimate the weight for giant barracudas along that entire range (given the parameters above). Store the output as `barracuda_weight`.

::: {.callout-important}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
barracuda_weight <- fish_weight_g(length_cm = fish_length, a = 0.0181, b = 3.27)
```
:::

l. Bind the lengths and estimated barracuda weights into a single data frame using `data.frame()`

::: {.callout-important}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
barracuda_df <- data.frame(fish_length, barracuda_weight)
# View(barracuda_df)
```
:::

m. Create a ggplot graph of predicted length versus weight for giant barracuda

::: {.callout-important}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = barracuda_df, aes(x = fish_length, y = barracuda_weight)) +
  geom_point()
```
:::

n. Update the graph axis labels and title

::: {.callout-important}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = barracuda_df, aes(x = fish_length, y = barracuda_weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Predicted barracuda weights, estimated from fish lengths",
       x = "Length (cm)",
       y = "Standard weight (g)")
```
:::

o. Render the `.qmd`. Make sure everything is saved.
p. Close your project. Reopen the project, and ensure that you can re-run the entire Quarto document (reproducibility check).
