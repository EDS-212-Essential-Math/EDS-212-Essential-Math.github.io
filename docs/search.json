In the intensive EDS 212 course, students will refresh fundamental skills in basic math (algebra, uni- and multivariate functions, units and unit conversions), derivative and integral calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and reading, writing and evaluating logical operations.\nThe goal of EDS 212 (Essential Math in Environmental Data Science) is to prepare incoming MEDS students with quantitative methods, skills, notation and language commonly used in environmental data science and required for their data science courses and projects in the program. By the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nPerform the following by hand and in R: convert units, basic algebra and working with logs and exponentials; write, interpret and evaluate univariate and multivariate functions; basic derivatives and integrals with univariate and multivariate functions; solve simple differential equations; basic operations with scalars, vectors and matrices; writing and evaluating logicals\nExplain and share examples for how all topics in EDS 212 are useful and used in applied environmental data science\nInterpret examples of applied math & models from environmental science case studies\nWork with peers to solve group tasks, then communicate the process of problem solving to the rest of the class"

Basic calculations in the Console\nNext, let’s familiarize ourselves with some basic operations in the Console:\n\nPressing Enter / Return will immediately execute a line of code typed into the Console. Try using some of the common operators (*, /, +, -, ^), as well as functions to perform calculations in the Console:\n\n\n# perform calculations using operators:\n7 * 11\n21 / 3\n1 + 1\n4 - 3\n4 ^ 2\n\n# perform calculations using functions: \nsqrt(4) # compute the square root\nlog10(100) # compute the common (base 10) logarithm\nlog(2) # compute the natural logarithm\n\n\nCool! But what exactly is a function? Functions are self-contained pieces of code, which are built to accomplish a specific task. They accept inputs (we call these arguments), and return outputs.\n\nCheck out the R documentation for a function using the syntax, ?function_name. For example, try running, ?log, in the Console\n\nThe documentation tells us that log() computes the natural logarithm and takes two arguments, x and base. base is already set to a default value (exp(1)), which we can update if desired. We must supply a value for the x argument in order for the function to execute, since x is not set to any default value. The Arguments section of the documentation tells us that x can be a numeric or complex vector. We can supply just our numeric value (e.g. 2), or explicitly include the argument name as well:\n\n\n\n\nlog(2)\nlog(x = 2)\n\n\nStore objects using the assignment operator, &lt;-. Any objects (also called variables) will appear in the Environment tab. Use snake_case and always start object names off with a letter (and not a number). For example:\n\n\ncurrent_year &lt;- 2024 \nclass_num &lt;- \"EDS 212\"\ntemp_c &lt;- 17.4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s Restart our R session by clicking Session &gt; Restart R.
