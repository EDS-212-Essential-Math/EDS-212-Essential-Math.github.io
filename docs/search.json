You can also override the default using the hashpipe #| within a code chunk, followed by the execution option (e.g. #| echo: false ).\n\nUpdate the code chunk options so the warnings and messages are hidden, but the library(tidyverse) code does show up in your knitted document.

Update so that the color of the points changes based on the value of mass (this is unnecessary, but just for customization practice). Update axis labels (with units). Remember, use ?starwars for more information. Check the warnings that show up when you run your code. What are they telling you? Then, update the code chunk option so that only the graph appears in your rendered document (i.e. no code or warnings are printed in your rendered doc).

Update the fill color to purple, and the line color to red (this will look awful - do it anyway for practice). Update the x- and y-axis labels. Update your code chunk options so that only your code and the output graph shows up in the knitted document (i.e. no warnings).

Make, stage, commit & push some changes\n\nIn your .qmd, make some changes (whatever you want). Save. Render (or not…as long as one file changes).\nNotice that in the git tab in RStudio, the file(s) you updated show up as having been updated.\nStage (check box next to files), Commit (add commit message), Pull (for habit to check for remote changes), then Push to the remote repo.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nPerform the following by hand and in R: convert units, basic algebra and working with logs and exponentials; write, interpret and evaluate univariate and multivariate functions; basic derivatives and integrals with univariate and multivariate functions; solve simple differential equations; basic operations with scalars, vectors and matrices; writing and evaluating logicals\nExplain and share examples for how all topics in EDS 212 are useful and used in applied environmental data science\nInterpret examples of applied math & models from environmental science case studies\nWork with peers to solve group tasks, then communicate the process of problem solving to the rest of the class"

    "section": "2. Matrices",
    "text": "2. Matrices\n\nA matrix contains data of a single class (usually numbers). Which means that we can think of the contents of a matrix as a single sequence of values, that are constrained (wrapped) to the specified dimensions of the matrix.\nFor example, let’s say we have 10 values:\n\n# Make a sequence of values from 1 - 10 ----\nmy_values &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 10)\n\n# Look at it (always) ----\nmy_values\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nNow, we can convert this into a matrix by letting R know how many rows these values should be “wrapped” into (the default is to populate by column…see documentation, and always look at what you’ve created):\n\n# Convert to matrix ----\nmy_matrix &lt;- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Check it out ----\nmy_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4    5\n[2,]    6    7    8    9   10\n\n\nTry some other variations to make a matrix from my_values to test it out. What happens if you don’t have enough elements in the matrix to contain your vector?\nFor example:\n\nmatrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\nWarning in matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE): data\nlength [10] is not a sub-multiple or multiple of the number of columns [3]\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    2    3\n[2,]    4    5    6\n\n\nWhat happens if your matrix has more elements than your vector?\nFor example:\n\nmatrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)\n\nWarning in matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE): data\nlength [10] is not a sub-multiple or multiple of the number of rows [3]\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4\n[2,]    5    6    7    8\n[3,]    9   10    1    2\n\n\nSo…always, always, always look at what you’ve created.\n\nScalar multiplication, addition and subtraction\nScalar multiplication of a matrix is straightforward: just use the multiply operator (*):\n\n4 * my_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    4    8   12   16   20\n[2,]   24   28   32   36   40\n\n\nAddition/subtraction requires matrices of the same dimension. Let’s make another 2x5 matrix:\n\n# Make 2x5 matrix ----\nmy_values2 &lt;- seq(from = 21, to = 30)\nmy_matrix2 &lt;- matrix(my_values2, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Check it out ----\nmy_matrix2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   21   22   23   24   25\n[2,]   26   27   28   29   30\n\n\nAdd the two matrices:\n\nmy_matrix + my_matrix2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   22   24   26   28   30\n[2,]   32   34   36   38   40\n\n\nSimilarly for subtraction:\n\nmy_matrix2 - my_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   20   20   20   20   20\n[2,]   20   20   20   20   20\n\n\n\n\nMatrix multiplication\nAs we saw in lecture, matrix multiplication is a bit more complicated (dot products of rows by columns become elements in the resulting matrix). Here’s a reminder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe multiply matrices in R using the same operator as the dot product for vectors: %*%\nFor example:\n\n# Make a couple of 2x2 matrices ----\ncats &lt;- matrix(data = c(0,4,3,1), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\ndogs &lt;- matrix(data = c(6,-3,0,2), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Look at them ----\ncats\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    4\n[2,]    3    1\n\ndogs\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    6   -3\n[2,]    0    2\n\n# Matrix multiplication ----\ncats %*% dogs\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    8\n[2,]   18   -7\n\n\nConfirm that this is correct by doing the matrix multiplication by hand."

But what exactly is a function? Functions are self-contained pieces of code, which are built to accomplish a specific task. They accept inputs (we call these arguments), and return outputs.\n\nCheck out the R documentation for a function using the syntax, ?function_name. For example, try running, ?sqrt, in the Console\n\nThe documentation tells us that sqrt() computes the (principle) square root of x, \\(\\sqrt{x}\\), and takes one argument, x. We must supply a value for the x argument in order for the function to execute. The Arguments section of the documentation tells us that x can be a numeric or complex vector or array. We can supply just our numeric value (e.g. 4), or explicitly include the argument name as well:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Console\n\nsqrt(4)\nsqrt(x = 4)\n\n\n\nStore objects using the assignment operator, &lt;-.

    "text": "6. Our first function\nWe’ll get into the weeds of functions in EDS 221. For now, we’ll create functions to quickly do repeated calculations, and to familiarize ourselves with function notation.\nGeneral function notation looks like this:\n\nfunction_name &lt;- function(argument_1, argument_2) {\n\n  function_body\n\n}\n\nFor example, let’s make a function to help us convert units of \\(\\frac{g}{cm^3}\\) to \\(\\frac{kg}{ft^3}\\), given that \\(1 cm^3 = 3.531\\times10^{-5}ft^3\\)\n\nFirst, we should write down the dimensional analysis to keep our conversion straight (this is worth writing out by hand, every time):\n\n\\[\\frac{g}{cm^3}*\\frac{1 kg}{1000 g}*\\frac{1cm^3}{3.531\\times10^{-5}ft^3}\\]\n\nLet’s add a new code chunk to our Quarto doc, then make a function that will convert any value input in \\(\\frac{g}{cm^3}\\) to \\(\\frac{kg}{ft^3}\\):\n\n\n\n\n.qmd\n\nconvert_units &lt;- function(value_g_cm3) {\n  value_kg_ft3 = value_g_cm3 * (1 / 1000) * (1 / 3.531e-5)\n  print(value_kg_ft3)\n}\n\n\n\nTry it out! Convert \\(50\\frac{g}{cm^3}\\) to \\(\\frac{kg}{ft^3}\\) using the function you’ve created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.qmd\n\nconvert_units(50)\n\n\n[1] 1416.029"

    "text": "7. Close & reopen - no precious outputs or objects\nIf you are writing code reproducibly, you should be able to close the file you’re working in without stress. That’s because all of your stored objects - functions, variables, etc. - should be recreated by opening and re-running the code in your file. If you cannot do that, then your code is not reproducible.\nThat means that your scripted code is what is precious - and we want to build bomb-proof strategies for making sure it’s safe.\nWhich brings us to a critical lesson: Create things like you expect your computer to explode at any minute. Your computer is NOT a safe place. Where is? Someone away from your local computer…somewhere cloudlike and wonderful. Somewhere like GitHub (coming up soon!).\n\n\nEnd interactive session 1A"
