But what exactly is a function? Functions are self-contained pieces of code, which are built to accomplish a specific task. They accept inputs (we call these arguments), and return outputs.\n\nCheck out the R documentation for a function using the syntax, ?function_name. For example, try running, ?log, in the Console\n\nThe documentation tells us that log() computes the natural logarithm and takes two arguments, x and base. base is already set to a default value (exp(1)), which we can update if desired. We must supply a value for the x argument in order for the function to execute, since x is not set to any default value. The Arguments section of the documentation tells us that x can be a numeric or complex vector. We can supply just our numeric value (e.g. 2), or explicitly include the argument name as well:\n\n\n\n\nlog(2)\nlog(x = 2)\n\n\nStore objects using the assignment operator, &lt;-.

Given the differential equation:\n\\[\\frac{dP}{dt}=0.4P(0.5 - P)\\]\nand the initial condition \\(P(0)=0.2\\), approximate the solution \\(P(t)\\) at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nFirst, what is \\(t\\), \\(P\\), and \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) at \\(t = 0\\)? Here we have the initial condition, and can calculate the slope:\n\n\n\n\n\nt\nP\ndfdx\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.2\n0.024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we approximate the value of \\(P(t)\\) and \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) at the next step (\\(t = 1\\)) as if the slope is continuing at 0.024. Which means the approximate value of \\(P(1) = 0.2 + 0.024*(1) = 0.224\\). At that value of \\(P\\), the slope is approximated by \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}=0.4*0.224(0.5 - 0.224) = 0.02473\\).\nSo now, our table is expand to:\n\n\n\n\n\nt\nP\ndfdx\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.200\n0.02400\n\n\n1\n0.224\n0.02473\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we continue. What do we approximate is the value of P(t) at t = 2? Using the new slope of 0.01056, the approximate value of \\(P(2) = 0.224 + 0.02473*1 = 0.24873\\). Using that value, we approximate the slope at \\(t=2\\) by \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}=0.4*0.24873(0.5 - 0.24873) = 0.024999\\).\nOur table is then updated to:\n\n\n\n\n\nt\nP\ndfdx\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.20000\n0.024000\n\n\n1\n0.22400\n0.024730\n\n\n2\n0.24873\n0.024999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we could continue doing that for many incremental values of \\(t\\) to get an approximate solution for what the function \\(P(t)\\) looks like. But that would be very tedious. Up next - computer help!\n\nSummary: numerical approximation\nThere are many different approaches to numerical approximation of solutions for differential equations. This example is meant to give you an idea of how the iterative approximation works generally.\nNow, let’s see how much more quickly we can do this with some computer power!"

    "text": "Numerical approximation using deSolve::ode()\nAllison update (2021-08-03): For time, students will FORK my repo (https://github.com/allisonhorst/eds212-comp-3a), then we’ll talk through the code. Lotke-Volterra example shown below is the same that students will run from that repo.\n\nA basic starter\nLet’s say we have a system modeled by:\n\\[\\frac{dC}{dt}=\\lambda C^2-3.1\\delta\\] and we don’t know how to solve this analytically. Let’s use deSolve in R to help us find a solution numerically, given an initial condition at \\(C(0)=4.8\\) and for parameter values \\(\\lambda = 0.4\\) and \\(\\delta=0.06\\).\nHere’s what a numeric solution looks like with deSolve:\nFirst, we’ll make a time sequence that we want to estimate numerical solutions over:\n\n# Create a time sequence:\ntime_seq &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 0.2, by = 0.001)\n\nThen, we’ll store the parameter(s) and initial conditions:\n\n# Set some parameter values (these can change - keep it in mind):\nparameter_example &lt;- c(lambda = 0.4, delta = 0.06)\n\n# Set the initial condition (prey and predator populations at t = 0).\n# Recall: x = prey, y = predator\ninit_cond_example &lt;- c(C = 4.8)\n\nStore the differential equation as a function:\n\n# Prepare the series of differential equations as a function: \ndf_equation_example &lt;- function(time_seq, init_cond_example, parameter_example) {\n  with(as.list(c(init_cond_example, parameter_example)), {\n    dcdt = lambda * C ^ 2 - 3.1 * delta\n    return(list(c(dcdt)))\n  })\n}\n\nUse deSolve::ode() to approximate the solution numerically:\n\n# Find the approximate the solution using `deSolve::ode()`:\napprox_df_example &lt;- ode(y = init_cond_example, times = time_seq, func = df_equation_example, parms = parameter_example)\n\n# Check the class: \nclass(approx_df_example)\n\n[1] \"deSolve\" \"matrix\" \n\n# We really want this to be a data frame:\napprox_df_example &lt;- data.frame(approx_df_example)\n\n# Plot it! \nggplot(data = approx_df_example, aes(x = time, y = C)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lotke-Volterra equations\nNow let’s try it for something a bit more interesting! As described in the lecture, the Lotke-Volterra models have been used to describe predator-prey populations.\n\nPrey equation:\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\alpha x-\\beta xy\\]\nFrom Wikipedia: “The prey are assumed to have an unlimited food supply and to reproduce exponentially, unless subject to predation; this exponential growth is represented in the equation above by the term \\(\\alpha x\\). The rate of predation upon the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet, this is represented above by \\(\\beta xy\\). If either x or y is zero, then there can be no predation.”\n\n\nPredator equation:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\delta xy - \\gamma y\\]\nFrom Wikipedia: “In this equation, \\(\\delta xy\\) represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used, as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey). The term \\(\\gamma y\\) represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration, it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey.\nWhere:\n\n\\(x\\) is prey population (e.g. rabbits)\n\\(y\\) is predator population (e.g. wolves)\n\\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta\\) are positive parameters\n\nTo find an approximate solution in R, we will need four things: - Parameter values - A sequence of times over which we’ll approximate predator & prey populations - An initial condition (initial populations of predator & prey at t = 0) - The differential equations that need to be solved\nSolving the Lotke-Volterra equation:\n\n# Create a sequence of times (days): \ntime &lt;- seq(0, 25, by = 0.05)\n\n# Set some parameter values (these can change - keep it in mind):\nparameters &lt;- c(alpha = .75, beta = 0.8, delta = 0.5, gamma = 1)\n\n# Set the initial condition (prey and predator populations at t = 0).\n# Recall: x = prey, y = predator\ninit_cond &lt;- c(x = 5, y = 2)\n\n# Prepare the series of differential equations as a function: \nlk_equations &lt;- function(time, init_cond, parameters) {\n  with(as.list(c(init_cond, parameters)), {\n    dxdt = alpha * x - beta * x * y\n    dydt = delta * x * y - gamma * y\n    return(list(c(dxdt, dydt)))\n  })\n}\n\n# Find the approximate the solution using `deSolve::ode()`:\napprox_lk &lt;- ode(y = init_cond, times = time, func = lk_equations, parms = parameters)\n\n# Check the class: \nclass(approx_lk)\n\n[1] \"deSolve\" \"matrix\" \n\n# We really want this to be a data frame, and we want both prey (x) and predator (y) to be in the same column -- we'll learn why in EDS 221 (tidy data)\napprox_lk_df &lt;- data.frame(approx_lk) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(x,y), names_to = \"species\", values_to = \"population\")\n\n# Plot it! \nggplot(data = approx_lk_df, aes(x = time, y = population)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = species))"

    "text": "3. Matrices\n\nA matrix contains data of a single class (usually numbers). Which means that we can think of the contents of a matrix as a single sequence of values, that are constrained (wrapped) to the specified dimensions of the matrix.\nFor example, let’s say we have 10 values:\n\n# Make a sequence of values from 1 - 10 ----\nmy_values &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 10)\n\n# Look at it (always) ----\nmy_values\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nNow, we can convert this into a matrix by letting R know how many rows these values should be “wrapped” into (the default is to populate by column…see documentation, and always look at what you’ve created):\n\nmy_matrix &lt;- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Check it out! ----\nmy_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4    5\n[2,]    6    7    8    9   10\n\n\nTry some other variations to make a matrix from my_values to test it out. What happens if you don’t have enough elements in the matrix to contain your vector? What happens if your matrix has more elements than your vector?\nFor example:\n\nmatrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)\n\nWarning in matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE): data\nlength [10] is not a sub-multiple or multiple of the number of rows [3]\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4\n[2,]    5    6    7    8\n[3,]    9   10    1    2\n\n\nSo…always, always, always look at what you’ve created.\n\nScalar multiplication, addition and subtraction\nScalar multiplication of a matrix is straightforward: just use the multiply operator (*):\n\n4 * my_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    4    8   12   16   20\n[2,]   24   28   32   36   40\n\n\nAddition/subtraction requires matrices of the same dimension. Let’s make another 2x5 matrix:\n\nmy_values_2 &lt;- seq(from = 21, to = 30)\nmy_matrix_2 &lt;- matrix(my_values_2, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Check it out ----\nmy_matrix_2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   21   22   23   24   25\n[2,]   26   27   28   29   30\n\n\nAdd the two matrices:\n\nmy_matrix + my_matrix_2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   22   24   26   28   30\n[2,]   32   34   36   38   40\n\n\nSimilarly for subtraction:\n\nmy_matrix_2 - my_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   20   20   20   20   20\n[2,]   20   20   20   20   20\n\n\n\n\nMatrix multiplication\nAs we saw in lecture, matrix multiplication is a bit more complicated (dot products of rows by columns become elements in the resulting matrix). Here’s a reminder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe multiply matrices in R using the same operator as the dot product for vectors: %*%\nFor example:\n\n# Make a couple of 2x2 matrices ----\ncats &lt;- matrix(data = c(0,4,3,1), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\ndogs &lt;- matrix(data = c(6,-3,0,2), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Look at them ----\ncats\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    4\n[2,]    3    1\n\ndogs\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    6   -3\n[2,]    0    2\n\n# Matrix multiplication ----\ncats %*% dogs\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    8\n[2,]   18   -7\n\n\nConfirm that this is correct by doing the matrix multiplication by hand."

In the intensive EDS 212 course, students will refresh fundamental skills in basic math (algebra, uni- and multivariate functions, units and unit conversions), derivative and integral calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and reading, writing and evaluating logical operations.\nThe goal of EDS 212 (Essential Math in Environmental Data Science) is to prepare incoming MEDS students with quantitative methods, skills, notation and language commonly used in environmental data science and required for their data science courses and projects in the program. By the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nPerform the following by hand and in R: convert units, basic algebra and working with logs and exponentials; write, interpret and evaluate univariate and multivariate functions; basic derivatives and integrals with univariate and multivariate functions; solve simple differential equations; basic operations with scalars, vectors and matrices; writing and evaluating logicals\nExplain and share examples for how all topics in EDS 212 are useful and used in applied environmental data science\nInterpret examples of applied math & models from environmental science case studies\nWork with peers to solve group tasks, then communicate the process of problem solving to the rest of the class"

Vectors\n\nVectors in R\nComplete the following in your Quarto doc, r-vectors.qmd:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate vectors in R using c().\n\n\n\nNote that all elements in a vector must be a single class (e.g. all strings or all numeric values) - if strings and numbers are combined, the whole thing will be of class character.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n# Create and store the vector ----\nmarmots &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"green\", 4, \"yellow\")\n\n# Return it ----\nmarmots\n\n[1] \"blue\"   \"green\"  \"4\"      \"yellow\"\n\n# Check the class ----\nclass(marmots)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIf all values are numeric, however, it will be stored as a number:\n\n# Create and store the vector ----\npika &lt;- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.8, 5)\n\n# Return it ----\npika\n\n[1] 12.4  6.8  2.9  8.8  5.0\n\n# Check the class ----\nclass(pika)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nNotice in the vector above, these are class numeric. If values should be integers (often the case with count data), you can add an L after the value.\n\n# Create the integer vector ----\nbear &lt;- c(20L, 3L, 5L, 18L, 23L)\n\n# Look at it ----\nbear\n\n[1] 20  3  5 18 23\n\n# Check the class ----\nclass(bear) \n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nWe learn something important here: even numbers can be stored in R in different ways: floats are numbers that have decimals (these show up as class numeric) and integers, numbers without decimals (these show up as class integer).\nYou’ll learn about data representation and other classes of data in EDS 221.\n\n\nVector addition and subtraction, scalar multiplier, and dot product\nYou can add or subtract numeric vectors of equal length using basic operations.

    "text": "3. Matrices\n\nMatrices in R\nA matrix contains data of a single class (usually numbers). Which means that we can think of the contents of a matrix as a single sequence of values, that are constrained (wrapped) to the specified dimensions of the matrix.\nFor example, let’s say we have 10 values:\n\n# Make a sequence of values from 1 - 10 ----\nmy_values &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 10)\n\n# Look at it (always) ----\nmy_values\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nNow, we can convert this into a matrix by letting R know how many rows these values should be “wrapped” into (the default is to populate by column…see documentation, and always look at what you’ve created):\n\n# Convert to matrix ----\nmy_matrix &lt;- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Check it out! ----\nmy_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4    5\n[2,]    6    7    8    9   10\n\n\nTry some other variations to make a matrix from my_values to test it out. What happens if you don’t have enough elements in the matrix to contain your vector? What happens if your matrix has more elements than your vector?\nFor example:\n\nmatrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)\n\nWarning in matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE): data\nlength [10] is not a sub-multiple or multiple of the number of rows [3]\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4\n[2,]    5    6    7    8\n[3,]    9   10    1    2\n\n\nSo…always, always, always look at what you’ve created.\n\n\nScalar multiplication, addition and subtraction\nScalar multiplication of a matrix is straightforward: just use the multiply operator (*):\n\n4 * my_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]    4    8   12   16   20\n[2,]   24   28   32   36   40\n\n\nAddition/subtraction requires matrices of the same dimension. Let’s make another 2x5 matrix:\n\nmy_values_2 &lt;- seq(from = 21, to = 30)\nmy_matrix_2 &lt;- matrix(my_values_2, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Check it out ----\nmy_matrix_2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   21   22   23   24   25\n[2,]   26   27   28   29   30\n\n\nAdd the two matrices:\n\nmy_matrix + my_matrix_2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   22   24   26   28   30\n[2,]   32   34   36   38   40\n\n\nSimilarly for subtraction:\n\nmy_matrix_2 - my_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]\n[1,]   20   20   20   20   20\n[2,]   20   20   20   20   20\n\n\n\n\nMatrix multiplication\nAs we saw in lecture, matrix multiplication is a bit more complicated (dot products of rows by columns become elements in the resulting matrix). Here’s a reminder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe multiply matrices in R using the same operator as the dot product for vectors: %*%\nFor example:\n\n# Make a couple of 2x2 matrices ----\ncats &lt;- matrix(data = c(0,4,3,1), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\ndogs &lt;- matrix(data = c(6,-3,0,2), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Look at them ----\ncats\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    4\n[2,]    3    1\n\ndogs\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    6   -3\n[2,]    0    2\n\n# Matrix multiplication ----\ncats %*% dogs\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    8\n[2,]   18   -7\n\n\nConfirm that this is correct by doing the matrix multiplication by hand.\n\nEnd interactive session 3B"

Making sequences in R\nSometimes we’ll want to create sequences of values that we can plug into a function to see how an output value changes over a range of inputs.\nWe can make a sequence of values, stored as a vector in R, using the seq() function.

Another option is to specify the length of the output vector instead - like “I want to have 30 values between 2 and 18, evenly spaced.” To do that, use the length = argument within the seq() function.\n\nseq(from = 2, to = 18, length = 30)\n\n [1]  2.000000  2.551724  3.103448  3.655172  4.206897  4.758621  5.310345\n [8]  5.862069  6.413793  6.965517  7.517241  8.068966  8.620690  9.172414\n[15]  9.724138 10.275862 10.827586 11.379310 11.931034 12.482759 13.034483\n[22] 13.586207 14.137931 14.689655 15.241379 15.793103 16.344828 16.896552\n[29] 17.448276 18.000000"
